      <h3><b>CerebroVis: Designing an Abstract yet Spatially Contextualized Cerebral Artery Network Visualization </b></h3>

      <p> <b>Abstract:</b> Blood circulation in the human brain is supplied through a network of cerebral arteries. If a clinician suspects a patient has a stroke or other cerebrovascular condition they order imaging tests. Neuroradiologists visually search the resulting scans for abnormalities. Their visual search tasks correspond to the abstract network analysis tasks of browsing and path following. To assist neuroradiologists in identifying cerebral artery abnormalities we designed CerebroVis, a novel abstract---yet spatially contextualized---cerebral artery network visualization. In this design study, we contribute a novel framing and definition of the cerebral artery system in terms of network theory and characterize neuroradiologist domain goals as abstract visualization and network analysis tasks. Through an iterative, user-centered design process we developed an abstract network layout technique which incorporates cerebral artery spatial context. The abstract visualization enables increased domain task performance over 3D geometry representations, while including spatial context helps preserve the user's mental map of the underlying geometry. We provide open source implementations of our network layout technique and prototype cerebral artery visualization tool. We demonstrate the robustness of our technique by successfully laying out 61 open source brain scans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our layout through a mixed methods study with three neuroradiologists. In a formative controlled experiment our study participants used CerebroVis and a conventional 3D visualization to examine real cerebral artery imaging data and to identify a simulated intracranial artery stenosis. Participants were more accurate at identifying stenoses using CerebroVis (absolute risk difference 13%).

      <p>Aditeya Pandey has fulfilled his paper requirement through the submission and acceptance of the paper “CerebroVis: Designing an Abstract yet Spatially Contextualized Cerebral Arteries Network Visualization” to be included in the proceedings of IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis) 2019 (AR 25%) and published in a special issue of the journal IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics in January 2020.  Aditeya is the first author of the paper, and was the project lead for the entirety of the task analysis, design process, system development, and evaluation study to final paper composition.  The project, motivated specifically by the question of how to best represent the cerebral (brain) arteries to a doctor for for the diagnosis of diseases including stroke, included Aditeya completing a thorough literature review of artery visualizations and more broadly visualization in medicine as well as tree and network visualization, a full medical task analysis, iterative design process to create the visualization, implementation of the novel algorithm and incorporation into a web-based tool for doctors, evaluation and validation of the algorithm and new visualization, and composition of the InfoVis submission.  Throughout this project Aditeya demonstrated independent research motivation, critical thinking, strategy, and problem solving.  This work demonstrates Aditeya’s ability to be an independent successful researcher and complete his dissertation.
